{"5":{"title":"The Stop Adani campaign strategy","content":"Without the proposed one billion dollar handout from the federal government, it’s very unlikely that the Adani coal mine will proceed. Fortunately, this handout is very unpopular with voters. Our strategy then is to talk to voters in key Liberal-held marginal electorates where there are moderate Liberal MPs. The theory is that given enough pressure, these MPs will speak out against the loan and force the government to rethink the loan."},"6":{"title":"The background of the Adani Company","content":"The Adani company is attempting to build one of the world’s largest coal mines in Northern Queensland. So far, they have not been able to secure any private finance for the project. However, a federal government body called the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility (or NAIF) has indicated they that may lend Adani one billion dollars to help the company build a rail line from the mine to a port. Technically this would be a loan, but can reasonably be described as a handout because it is a very high risk venture that contradicts the criteria that money is meant to be lent on. The Adani group has 26 companies operating in Australia, of which 13 are ultimately registered in the Cayman Islands, a notorious tax haven. Currently the federal government does not know which of these companies has actually applied for the loan. NAIF is a supposedly independent body, but the seven member board is stacked with people with strong connections to with the mining industry. We are expecting the NAIF board to make a decision on the funding sometime in the middle of the year."},"7":{"title":"The target MP and electorate","content":"test"},"8":{"title":"The conversation guide","content":"You should have a print out of the conversation guide."}}
